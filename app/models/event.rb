Luckily they also know a teleportation spell, and helpfully bypass all of those terrible places for those looking to retrieve the Heartpillow!",

They strike back against the scaley menaces with furious blows and are able to break free only slightly worse for wear.",

A raised shield and a sturdy arm is enough to deflect most of the damage, and a quick moltenspear leaves only ashes where the threat once stood, but boy, this place is tiring.",

A quarter of the way up, then half, nearly at the top and finally dragging themselves over to thump down on to the battlements.",

Striking out towards the heart of the fortress quickly reveals the reason for the eerie stillness; fallen bodies of rebels adorn the fortress halls, struck down with no mark of steel or spell.",

By the time they reach the bottom, the hum is all they can hear, and a steady trickle of blood runs from their nostrils."
